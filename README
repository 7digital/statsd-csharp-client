C# Statsd Client

Statsd s = new Statsd(new StatsdUDP(HOSTNAME,PORT));

//All the standard Statsd message types

s.Send<Statsd.Counting>("counter",1); //counter had one hit
s.Send<Statsd.Timing>("timer",5); //timer had one hit of 5ms
s.Send<Statsd.Gauge>("gauge",5); //gauge had one hit of value 5

//All types have sample rate, which will be included in the message for Statsd own stats crunching

s.Send<Statsd.Counting>("counter",1,1/10); //counter had one hit, this will be sent 10% of times it is called

//You can add combinations of messages which will be sent in one go;

s.Add<Statsd.Counting>("counter",1);
s.Add<Statsd.Timer>("timer",5,1/10);
s.Send(); //message will contain counter and will contain timer 10% of the times

//All previous commands will be flushed after any Send
//Any Adds will be ignored if using a Send directly

//Optional naming conventions
//environment named 'env'
//application named 'app'
//hostname named 'host'

string name = Naming.withEnvironmentApplicationAndHostname("stat"); //== "env.app.stat.host"
string anotherName  = Naming.withEnvironmentAndApplication("stat"); //== "env.app.stat"

//You can use Actions to time responses

s.Send(()=>DoMagic(),"timer",1/10); //time the response time for DoMagic
s.Send(()=>DoMagic(),"timer"); //same with no sample rate
s.Add(()=>DoMagic(),"timer"); //you can just add it too..
