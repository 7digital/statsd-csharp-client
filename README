C# Statsd Client

Statsd s = new Statsd(new StatsUDP(HOSTNAME,PORT));

//All the standard Statsd message types

s.Send<Statsd.Counting>("counter",1); //counter had one hit
s.Send<Statsd.Timing>("timer",5); //timer had one hit of 5ms
s.Send<Statsd.Gauge>("gauge",5); //gauge had one hit of value 5

//All types have sample rate, which will be included in the message

s.Send<Statsd.Counting>("counter",1,1/10); //counter had one hit, this will be sent 10% of times it is called

//You can add combinations of messages which will be sent in one go;
